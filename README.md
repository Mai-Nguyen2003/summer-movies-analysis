[Dataset Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umerhaddii/imdb-summer-movies-data)
### Tools
Python: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Creating Report<br/>
Library: Pandas, Matplotlib
### Process
#### Data Cleaning/ Preparation<br/>
In the data cleaning process, I perform these tasks:
 - Data loading
 - Handling missing values and removing duplicates
 - Formatting the data
#### Data Analysis
Exploring the movie data to answer key questions:
- How many movies are in the data ?
- How is the average rating score of movies ?
- Which is the most popular movie genre watched by the audience?
- Does the number of votes from the audience play an important role?
#### Data Visualization
Use Matplotlib to create charts to visualize data insights
#### Results/Findings:
- Movies produced between 1940 and 1960 have a high average point voted by the audience
- Comedy, Drama, and Horror are on the top of movie genres watched in the summer.
- The distribution of average rating scores focuses on points around 6 and 7.
- The movies with a 90-minute runtime have the highest vote from the audience.
#### Uncover Insights:
On the list of the top 5 movies with the highest rating scores, there are 2 documentary movies. The documentary genre also raises interest in history and discovery. A suitable, interesting movie type should be watched with family and friends.<br/>
It's quite surprising that Reality TV and Talk Show don't have so many votes from the audience.
#### Limitations
Some important values of features are not given, this affects the accuracy of my conclusions about my analysis.
